# 42 Project Cub3D 👋

> Cub3D is a 42 school project. In this project we need to recreate the principe
> of raycasting.
> Raycasting is a computer graphics technique mainly used in 3D rendering and video games to simulate a 3D
> perspective from a 2D world. It works by "casting rays" from the player's point of view into the game world to 
> figure out what should be visible on the screen.

> Raycasting was popularized by early 90s games like:
> Wolfenstein 3D (1992) Test the Game : [Wolfenstein 3D](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/)
> Doom (1993) Test the Game : [Doom](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_414-DOS.php)
